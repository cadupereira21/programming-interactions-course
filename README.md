# Programming Interactions Course

This is a prototype game developed following the "Programming interactions using C# scripts" from Unity Learn.

In this project I learned how to use the new Input System from Unity, as well as Cinemachine camera's. Moreover, there's a good example of the Command pattern in this project, which addresses the user's input handling in the code, delegating to the right actor's to perform an action based on an input.
